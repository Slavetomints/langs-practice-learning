// A local zoo wants to keep track of how many pounds of food each of its three 
// monkeys eats each day during a typical week. Write a program that stores this
// information in a two-dimensional 3 Ã— 5 array, where each row represents a 
// different monkey, and each column represents a different day of the week. The
// program should first have the user input the data for each monkey. Then, it 
// should create a report that includes the following information:
// 
// Average amount of food eaten per day by the whole family of monkeys
// The least amount of food eaten during the week by any one monkey
// The greatest amount of food eaten during the week by any one monkey
//
// Do not accept negative numbers for pounds of food eaten
