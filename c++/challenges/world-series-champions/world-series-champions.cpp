// Teams.txt - This file contains a list of several Major League baseball teams 
//             in alphabetical order. Each team listed in the file has won the 
//             World Series at least once.
// WorldSeriesWinners.txt - This file contains a chronological list of the 
//                          World Seriesâ€™ winning teams from 1903 to 2012. 
//                          (The first line in the file is the name of the team 
//                          that won in 1903, and the last line is the name of 
//                          the team that won in 2012. Note the World Series was
//                          not played in 1904 or 1994.)
//
// Write a program that displays the contents of the Teams.txt file on the 
// screen and prompts the user to enter the name of one of the teams. The 
// program should then display the number of times that team has won the World 
// Series in the time period from 1903 to 2012.
//
// TIP
// Read the contents of the WorldSeriesWinners.txt file into an array or vector.
// When the user enters the name of a team, the program should step through the 
// array or vector counting the number of times the selected team appears.
